## Edit: My Workflow
Unfortunately (or maybe not...) I wasn't sure what the outcome is expected to look like. Should it be just in the console or displayed for the user, where this "checkout" accepts the string etc. etc. That's why I actually treated the entire task just as having fun and another scenario to practice a bit :). Furthermore, I downplayed "spend up to two hours on it" enjoying making up new problems and sorting them out :D - I just like to add a bit more details and make it maybe a bit more "real" and more reusable like component. I'm hoping it will be seen as "advantage" as I actually was able to show more of my skills. 
Disclaimer: Intentionally I have not checked StackOverflow or any other forums for seeking how your discount should be coded. I wanted just to tackle it by myself to let you judge my way of thinking.

## Workflow
- Treat this like a real assignment, but only spend up to two hours on it - it doesn't matter how far you get
- Fork the project to your personal Github account (click on the fork button in the top right corner)
- Clone the forked version of this repository
- Include a `README`
- Push your work up to your fork
- Submit a link to your forked repository

## Instructions
You should implement a supermarket checkout which:
- always accepts a string of items and gives back the total price
- discounts any offers from the total price

Use the following pricing information:

| Item  | Price | Offer     |
| :---: | :---: | :---:     |
| A     | 50    | 3 for 130 |
| B     | 30    | 2 for 37  |
| C     | 20    | N/A       |
| D     | 10    | N/A       |

For example:
- `'DABA'` gives `140`
- `'BBBB'` gives `74`
